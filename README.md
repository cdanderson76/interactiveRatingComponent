<h1>This is my solution for the Interactive Rating Component</h1>

This is an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript challenge in which I practiced the basics (Flexbox, responsiveness, and JavaScript with light DOM manipulation.  With this challenge, you can click on any of the rating elements, and it simply renders a 'Thank You' page notifying you of what rating that you had given.

<h2>What are you most proud of, and what would you do differently next time?</h2>

Not sure what I'd do differently next time.  This was my first project implementing JavaScript, and I think I did ok.  I did take the time to plan my approach on this project, as I was nervous about going into it and getting stuck.  And while I DID get stuck, I learned a very valuable lesson about the developer tools in Chrome.

I can say that I'm most proud of the animations that I was able to include in this one.  I just wanted to find a way to make this my own unique version.  'I' think it looks pretty cool :) .

<h2>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you overcome them?</h2>

GETTING THE VALUES FROM THE LIST OF ELEMENTS.  I'm sure it was very easy for some, but everything that I had tried was amounting to errors and lots of repetitive 'undefined' alerts being thrown in my face.  But then it occurred to me that maybe I should make sure that I'm grabbing the list elements the appropriate way in JavaScript.  I opened my dev tools and 'console-logged' what I was grabbing.  Once I got something back, I took a deeper look inside to see if I could find what I wanted, and I found the values that I was trying to get.  After so many challenges and lessons with objects, it was smooth sailing from there.  I also had to google search how to highlight one of the list elements while 'un-highlighting' any other selections.  Did some digging in stack overflow and found what I was missing.  AND, I actually could understand what the code was doing...

<h2>What specific areas of your project would you like help with?</h2>

I think I got most of my answers that I had researched, but by all means, any productive input on how I can improve this is more than acceptable.
